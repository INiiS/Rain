# Rain - Tutorial

Game programming tutorial by TheChernoProject : [link here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98eOOCk2fOFg7Qg5yoQfFAdf)

This project follows the video series by The Cherno, and comments it, for future reference.


## Contributing
For now, no contributions will be merged into the master. Contributions that are either : 
* Advice
* Improvements of source code

will be merged when the project is over (that is : when I'm at the last video, #126).


## Acknowledgments

* TheChernoProject for his tutorial (obviously).
